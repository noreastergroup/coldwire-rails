    # response also sends `Service-Worker-Allowed` to widen it past that directory.
    attr_accessor :scope

    # The importmap module the offline page loads.
    #
    # Hotwire Native rejects any page where `window.Turbo` never appears — its adapter waits,
    # times out, and reports "Turbo is not present". So the fallback cannot be plain HTML; it
    # has to boot Turbo like a real page. Importing the whole app entry point would work but
    # is fragile offline: if any module in that graph is uncached the graph fails to evaluate
    # and Turbo never lands. Importing Turbo alone keeps the dependency to one file.
    #
    # Set to nil if you are not on importmap-rails, and override the offline page template to
    # load Turbo whatever way your bundler does.
    attr_accessor :offline_entry_point

    # Mark HTML served from cache because the network was unavailable, so the page can say
    # so. Adds `data-coldwire-offline` and `data-coldwire-cached-at` (unix seconds) to <html>,
    # plus a matching <meta> that survives Turbo's head merge. Costs a body rewrite, but only
    # on the offline path.
    attr_accessor :offline_marker

    # Treat "/map" and "/map?lat=1&zoom=9" as the same cached page, both when matching and
    # when storing. Blunt on purpose for now: it also collapses query strings that genuinely
    # select content, like `/search?q=`, so a cached result set can be served for a different
    # query. Set false if your app leans on query strings for anything you cache.
    attr_accessor :ignore_query_params

    # Paths the worker must never intercept, as prefix strings. Health checks and anything
    # streaming belong here. The engine's own paths are added automatically.
    #
    # Use this sparingly. An unintercepted request goes straight to the network, so offline
    # it fails outright — in Hotwire Native that means the SDK's own error screen, not your
    # offline page. If you only want to keep something out of the cache, use `cache_blocklist`.
    attr_accessor :excluded_paths

    # Which URLs automatic caching is allowed to store, and which it must not.
    #
    # Both accept strings and Regexps. A string matches the path as a segment prefix, so
    # "/users" covers "/users" and "/users/sign_in" but not "/username". A Regexp is tested
    # against the path, and is evaluated by JavaScript's RegExp — write JS-compatible syntax
    # (`^`/`$`, not `\A`/`\z`).
    #
    # An empty allowlist means "everything is allowed"; a non-empty one means "only these".
    # The blocklist always wins.
    #
    # **These govern automatic caching only.** Anything in the precache manifest is stored
    # regardless: listing a URL there is an explicit instruction, and quietly declining it
    # would make the manifest unpredictable.

    # pages hold whatever the previous session could see.
